## README

This project is about the smoothing algorithm of n-gram language model.

Two algorithms are implemented in this project: Add k and Hierarchical Interpolation

- For Add k, you don't need a valid set to train the model
- For Hierarchical Interpolation, you need a train set and a valid set to settle down the optimal parameters of the model.

Type $\texttt{python main.py}$ to run the code.
